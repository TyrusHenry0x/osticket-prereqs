<p>
I began by setting up a virtual machine in Azure, starting with the configuration of key settings. This included creating a resource group, assigning a name to the virtual machine, and selecting Windows 10 Pro as the operating system image.

</p>
<br />

<p>
Next, I created an administrator account for remote desktop access, and ensured that the licensing option was selected to avoid a validation error when continuing.

</p>
<br />

<p>
Moving forward, I added the virtual machine to Remote Desktop using its public IP address. To simplify management in complex environments, I recommend assigning a user-friendly name, as shown in the example below, to easily distinguish between machines..

</p>
<br />
<p>
At this Point I'm inside my Virtual Machine.

</p>
<br />
<p>
  
After that I downloaded the files neccessary to setup osTicket within my virtual machine, after that ill extract my zip file onto my desktop for easy access.

</p>
<br />

<p>The next step is to enable IIS(Internet Information Services) as well as enabling CGI. completing this will allow my machine to act as a web server.</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>Once that is finished I'm able to load the IIS default page located at 127.0.0.1</p>

<p>Moving forward I need a few dependencys installed, I'll start by creating a PHP folder inside my windows(C:) drive, from there I'll extract my PHP manager file in the folder.</p>

</p>
<br />

<p>After that I'll install my VC_redist file, and MySQL, these wil be used to store Tickets within a database. From there I'll laumch the Configuration Wizard and set both Username and Password to 'Root'</p>
ðŸ’¡: Even though I have my User and Password set as something fairly simple, I like to keep documentation of all of my logins in a sticky note.

</p>
<br />

<p>After that step is complete I'll open IIS as an Admin and register PHP from within IIS, then I'll reload to save the change I made.</p>
